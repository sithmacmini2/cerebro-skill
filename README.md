# CEREBRO — Strategic Intelligence Engine

> Scan, score, and connect knowledge across a markdown vault. Think like a strategist, not a search engine.

**Version:** 2.0.0 · **License:** MIT · **Author:** microhustlestack · **Python:** 3.11+

![Tests](https://github.com/microhustlestack/cerebro-skill/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

---

## What It Does

CEREBRO reads a structured markdown vault, scores every note on strategic value, detects time-sensitive signals, maps semantic relationships between entities, and surfaces actionable intelligence — including connections you did not know to look for.

It is not a search tool. It finds:

**Second-degree relationships** — A links to B, B links to C. CEREBRO surfaces A→C.

**Resource gaps** — multiple entities need X, nobody provides X.

**Compound opportunities** — combining 2-3 entities creates outsized value.

**Bottlenecks** — multiple entities depend on one shared constraint.

**Urgency signals** — deadlines, keywords, and frontmatter date fields classified as URGENT, HIGH, STANDARD, or PAST.

## Installation

### One-command install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microhustlestack/cerebro-skill.git
cd cerebro-skill
bash install.sh          # installs to Hermes, OpenClaw, and Claude Code
bash install.sh hermes   # install to one platform only
```

### Hermes

```bash
hermes skills tap add microhustlestack/cerebro-skill
hermes skills install cerebro
```

### Manual

Clone the repo and copy `SKILL.md` and `scripts/vault_parser.py` to your agent's skills folder.

---

## Quick Start

### Small vault (under 50 files) — brain analysis

Point your agent at the vault and trigger with natural language:

> "Run a CEREBRO intelligence scan on ~/Documents/Obsidian/my-vault"

The agent reads files directly, reasons semantically, and produces the report.

### Large vault (50+ files) — parser + brain analysis

```bash
# Install dependencies (PyYAML only)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 1. Build a JSON index and CEREBRO report in one command
python3 scripts/vault_parser.py /path/to/vault output/vault-index.json \
  --report cerebro_report.md \
  --query "grant opportunities Q2"

# 2. Feed the index to your agent for deeper semantic analysis
opencode run 'You are CEREBRO. Analyze vault-index.json and cerebro_report.md. Deepen the strategic insight: compound opportunities, second-degree connections, resource gaps.' \
  -f output/vault-index.json \
  -f cerebro_report.md
```

---

## The vault_parser.py Script

A production-grade Python parser bundled in `scripts/`. Parses every `.md` file and produces a structured JSON index with urgency signals and strategic scores.

**Dependencies:** Python 3.11+ · PyYAML only

```bash
# Basic scan — CEREBRO report to stdout
python3 scripts/vault_parser.py /path/to/vault

# JSON index only
python3 scripts/vault_parser.py /path/to/vault output/vault-index.json

# Full output — JSON index + report file + custom query label + top 15
python3 scripts/vault_parser.py /path/to/vault output/vault-index.json \
  --report cerebro_report.md \
  --query "find funding gaps" \
  --top 15
```

**What it extracts:**

YAML frontmatter, wikilinks (with display text and heading anchor resolution), backlinks, tags (frontmatter and inline), callouts, dataview queries, embedded files, markdown tables, code blocks, entity type inference, daily note detection.

**What it produces:**

Link graph, backlink graph, tag index, entity index, directory index, orphan detection, urgency signals per note, strategic scores per note, JSON export, CEREBRO INTELLIGENCE SCAN report.

---

## Scoring Model

Every note is scored on four dimensions. Composite score drives Top Matches ranking.

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Connectivity | 35% | Outgoing wikilinks + 2x incoming backlinks |
| Tag Influence | 25% | How widely this note's tags appear across the vault |
| Urgency | 25% | Derived from urgency signals (URGENT=1.0, HIGH=0.6, STANDARD=0.2) |
| Richness | 15% | Frontmatter, headings, word count, tables, callouts |

Composite score is a starting signal for the agent, not a final verdict. Semantic judgment overrides when warranted.

---

## Urgency Detection

VaultParser scans every note automatically for time-sensitive signals.

**Keywords detected:** urgent, asap, immediately, critical, time-sensitive, overdue, must act.

**Frontmatter fields checked:** deadline, due, due_date, submit_by, expires, closes, apply_by.

**ISO dates in body text** (YYYY-MM-DD) are detected and classified by days remaining.

| Days Until | Level |
|------------|-------|
| Past | PAST |
| 0-7 | URGENT |
| 8-30 | HIGH |
| 31+ | STANDARD |

---

## Output Format

Every CEREBRO run produces a report in this structure:

```
CEREBRO INTELLIGENCE SCAN
Scan: <subject/description>
Vault: <path or scope>
Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Entities analyzed: <count>

## Top Matches
Ranked by composite score. Each entry: name, score, type, link counts, tags, path, urgency signal.

## Key Connections
Second-degree relationships and tag clusters not made explicit by the vault.

## Strategic Insight
Dominant entity types, hub nodes, orphan count, urgency summary.

## Recommended Next Actions
1-6 concrete steps labeled URGENT / HIGH / STANDARD.
```

| Platform | Output destination |
|----------|--------------------|
| Hermes | `$CEREBRO_SKILL_DIR/output/cerebro_report.md` |
| Claude Code | `cerebro_report.md` in working directory |
| OpenClaw | `cerebro_report.md` + optional Telegram push |
| Opencode | stdout or `> cerebro_report.md` |
| Codex | `cerebro_report.md` written into workdir |

---

## Live Example

The sample report in [`samples/kepano-vault-report.md`](samples/kepano-vault-report.md) was generated by running CEREBRO on a real public Obsidian vault — [kepano/kepano-obsidian](https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian), the personal vault of Steph Ango, creator of the Obsidian Minimal Theme. 103 notes. No manual editing. Under 2 seconds.

```bash
python3 scripts/vault_parser.py kepano-obsidian/ output/vault-index.json \
  --report samples/kepano-vault-report.md
```

**What CEREBRO found:**

- 49 of 103 notes (47%) were orphaned — the vault stores knowledge but does not connect it
- Two notes (*Buy wisely* and *Product usage analysis*) covered the same decision framework from different angles and had never been wikilinked
- The Evergreen framework — the vault's stated intellectual foundation — existed in three places but the three nodes barely referenced each other
- A Kevin Kelly cluster (68 Bits of Advice + Out of Control + person note) shared a common source but had zero explicit connections
- Only 3 notes had any incoming backlinks across the entire 103-note vault

The full report with scores, second-degree connections, strategic insight, and ranked next actions is in [`samples/kepano-vault-report.md`](samples/kepano-vault-report.md).

## Platform-Specific Usage

### Hermes

Trigger naturally in chat:

> "Cerebro scan ~/Documents/Obsidian/Skills-Vault"

Or with a targeted query:

> "Show how 'zero-cost model' relates to 'model-fallback-protocol'"

### Claude Code

```bash
python3 scripts/vault_parser.py /path/to/vault output/vault-index.json \
  --report cerebro_report.md

claude -p "Run a CEREBRO intelligence scan. Deepen the analysis beyond the auto-generated report." \
  --file output/vault-index.json \
  --file cerebro_report.md
```

### Opencode

```bash
# Large vault
python3 scripts/vault_parser.py /path/to/vault /tmp/vault-index.json \
  --report /tmp/cerebro_report.md

opencode run 'You are CEREBRO. Analyze this vault index and report. Surface compound opportunities and second-degree relationships.' \
  -f /tmp/vault-index.json \
  -f /tmp/cerebro_report.md \
  --model openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4

# Small vault
opencode run 'Run a CEREBRO intelligence scan across these notes.' \
  $(find /path/to/vault -name "*.md" | head -40 | xargs -I{} echo "-f {}")
```

### Codex

Codex requires a git repo and `pty=true`:

```bash
python3 scripts/vault_parser.py /path/to/vault \
  /path/to/vault/vault-index.json --report /path/to/vault/cerebro_report.md

terminal(
  command="codex --full-auto exec 'You are CEREBRO. Read vault-index.json and cerebro_report.md. Deepen the analysis. Save to cerebro_report_v2.md.'",
  workdir="/path/to/vault",
  pty=true
)
```

If the vault is not a git repo:

```bash
TMPVAULT=$(mktemp -d)
cp -r /path/to/vault/. $TMPVAULT
cd $TMPVAULT && git init && git add -A && git commit -m 'init'
codex --full-auto exec 'Run a CEREBRO intelligence scan. Read all .md files and save cerebro_report.md.'
```

### OpenClaw

Trigger in chat, then push results to Telegram:

```bash
openclaw message send --target telegram:<your-id> --message "$(cat cerebro_report.md)"
```

---

## Ranking Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Relevance | High | How directly aligned are the entities? |
| Impact | High | Potential value if acted on? |
| Urgency | Medium | Time-sensitive? (deadlines, expiring opportunities) |
| Feasibility | Medium | How easy is it to act? |

## Use with LLM Wiki

> **LLM Wiki = your organized brain (structured knowledge)**
> **CEREBRO = your strategist (pattern recognition + decision engine)**

### The Simple Model

LLM Wiki answers: "What is this?" and "Where is that?"

CEREBRO answers: "What matters most right now?", "What's connected that I'm missing?", "Where is the opportunity?"

### The Workflow

**Step 1 — Ingest (LLM Wiki)**

Drop content into `raw/`: grant notes, meeting notes, ideas, articles.

**Step 2 — Structure (LLM Wiki)**

Content moves into `wiki/` with tags, links, categories, and indexes.

**Step 3 — Parse (CEREBRO)**

```bash
python3 scripts/vault_parser.py /path/to/vault output/vault-index.json \
  --report cerebro_report.md
```

Produces a link graph, tag index, urgency triage, strategic scores, and entity map.

**Step 4 — Analyze (CEREBRO Skill)**

Run queries like:

- "Find strongest connections between initiatives"
- "Identify underutilized resources"
- "Detect repeated bottlenecks"
- "Map stakeholder overlap"

**Step 5 — Output (Strategic Reports)**

Into `output/` — Top Opportunities, Strategic Gaps, High-Value Connections, Action Recommendations.

### Real Example

Say your vault contains: MSVL Sunset Concert Series, Taste of Juneteenth, Black Philanthropy Month, YESpvd, East 33.

LLM Wiki alone lets you find each program.

CEREBRO shows that:
- The same sponsors appear across 3 initiatives
- One initiative is under-leveraged
- One audience overlaps but is not monetized
- A single partnership strategy could unlock all 5

That is strategy. That is leverage.

### Intelligence Prompt (Plug-and-Play)

Use this with your parsed vault index:

```
SYSTEM ROLE:
You are CEREBRO, a strategic intelligence engine operating on a structured knowledge vault.

OBJECTIVE:
Analyze the provided vault data and generate a strategic intelligence report focused on leverage, opportunity, and system-level insights.

INPUT:
- Entity map
- Tag index
- Link graph
- Urgency signals
- Strategic scores

TASKS:
1. Identify the top 5 most connected entities (high leverage nodes)
2. Detect underutilized assets (low connection, high potential)
3. Surface hidden relationships between unrelated domains
4. Identify repeated bottlenecks or gaps
5. Recommend 5 strategic actions ranked by impact and urgency

OUTPUT FORMAT:

CEREBRO INTELLIGENCE REPORT

Top Leverage Nodes:
- [Entity]: reason

Hidden Opportunities:
- [Insight]

System Gaps:
- [Gap]

Key Connections:
- [Connection]

Recommended Actions:
1. [Action] (Impact: High, Urgency: High)
2. ...

TONE:
Direct, strategic. Focus on leverage and execution.
```
